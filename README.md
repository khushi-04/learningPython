## Self-learning Python with small projects

### Project 1: Sudoku Game

#### What I'm exploring:
* lists
* 2D Arrays
* NumPy applications
* Randomization

#### Game description: 
This is a sudoku game in progress. I included nine 3x3 boxes that all correspond with each other and each new game will include a new random set of numbers in the game. It's played in the terminal. 

#### Note:
I decided to scrap the project because I felt like I wasn't making enough progress quickly enough to actually learn that much. I switched to taking some beginner courses in python to get a better foundation on the subject.

#### What did I learn:
* The random library is helpful for generating any type of random number for any case.
* The NumPy library is very useful for manipulating and generating 2D and 3D arrays. It has a variety of functions that allow you to change the way an array looks and is structured a lot easier than just using lists. 
* While researching, I learned that Python is actually a slow language compared to other language, so it's not suitable for incredibly complex code. But the reason it's so popular is because of its readability and ease of use. 

### "Project" 2: Free Code Camp Notes and Exercises

#### What I'm exploring:
* python basics, coding basics and review

#### Description: 
I took this course as a way to review coding (I know C++ to an intermediate level) and get a better foundation on python.
