Project 1: Sudoku Game
    What I'm exploring:
        - lists
        - 2D Arrays
        - numpy applications
        - randomization
    Game description:
        This is a sudoku game in progress. I included nine 3x3 boxes that all correspond with each other and each new game will include a new random set of numbers in the game. It's played in the terminal. 
    Progress so far:
        I'm still working on how to actually generate the boxes using numpy and randomization. I've been able to generate 4 boxes with random numbers that follow the sudoku rules so far. They are also formatted in the way that I want. Now I just have to do it for the rest of the boxes, which is where it might get a little complicated.    
    What did I learn:
        - The random library is helpful for generating any types of random numbers for any case.
        - The numpy library is very useful for manipulating and generating 2D and 3D arrays. It has a variety of functions that allow you to change the way an array looks and is structured a lot easier than just using lists.
