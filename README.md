## Self-learning Python with small projects

### Project 1: Sudoku Game

#### What I'm exploring:
* lists
* 2D Arrays
* NumPy applications
* Randomization

#### Game description: 
This is a sudoku game in progress. I included nine 3x3 boxes that all correspond with each other and each new game will include a new random set of numbers in the game. It's played in the terminal. 

#### Progress so far:
8/5: I'm still working on how to actually generate the boxes using Numpy and randomization. It's been really confusing since I can't get the numbers to randomize and they repeat between the rows. 

8/7: I've been able to generate 4 boxes with random numbers that follow the sudoku rules so far. They are also formatted in the way that I want. Now I have to do it for the rest of the boxes, which is where it might get a little complicated.

8/9: One of the frustrating things I've been dealing with is my code not running properly in the terminal. I'll have to spend some time debugging and finding help from the internet. But I did get the solution function to start working correctly, following the rules of sudoku! I also have a decent introduction in main. 

#### What did I learn:
* The random library is helpful for generating any type of random number for any case.
* The NumPy library is very useful for manipulating and generating 2D and 3D arrays. It has a variety of functions that allow you to change the way an array looks and is structured a lot easier than just using lists. 
* While researching, I learned that Python is actually a slow language compared to other language, so it's not suitable for incredibly complex code. But the reason it's so popular is because of its readability and ease of use.
